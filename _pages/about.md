I am an idealistic, risk-taking, introverted, nerdy foodie, studying computational approaches for agriculture. In particular, I apply machine learning, Bayesian optimization, and complex systems to agricultural production and policy analysis.

I grew up digital in Japan. While turning to physics and mathematics in high school and (first) college, computers had never ceased to fascinate me. Circa 2000, when starting tech businesses was ever so cool, as a natural course of action, I dropped out, became a software engineer, and eventually started my own business. While developing resource management software for small-scale farmers and interacting with them, I found growing plants fascinating and much room for improving food systems. The idea of local food system began to dawn on me.

To test my hunch, I developed an online service that delivered fresh produce to local people and facilitated interactions among them. In 2010, being convinced of its potential and seeking systematic knowledge, I went to New Zealand to study agribusiness at Massey University. However, as my interests drifted from entrepreneurship to research, he decided to pursue an academic career that, I believed, could make me more useful for the society. In 2015, the year after completing an honours degree in economics at the Australian National University, I came to Madison, WI for PhD. His research focuses on applications of novel methods to agriculture, especially machine learning, optimization, and complex systems.
